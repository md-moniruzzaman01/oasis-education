        <p className='py-4'>Single-entry visas are only valid for entering Japan on a single occasion. The period of validity of the single-entry visa is of a three-month duration. It is also important to ensure that the bearer of the Japanese visa applies for landing with an immigration inspector at the port of entry where he/she seeks to land and undergo an examination for landing before the visa expires. The visa will become invalid once he/she has applied for landing or may be expired by reaching its normal expiry date which is much earlier, especially if applied for an initial 3-month duration.

            <p className='py-4'>Japanese immigration law requires that the Ministry of Justice has the authority to consider, based on an application, whether a foreign student/ person who wishes to enter Japan must satisfy the requirements for landing, which is related to the status of residence and to issue the document certifying the status of residence to which the activities he/she must be into, in correspond. This document, known as the “Certificate of Eligibility,” is issued by the regional immigration bureau. If one wishes to stay for a longer period of time in Japan to work or study, it is a must to obtain a certificate through your embassy representative in Japan. Applying for a visa with a COE makes the visa application process a much straightforward and a simpler process.
            <span className='block'>COE is issued 45 days prior to the school program in Japan. The COE is valid for 90 days from the date of issuance. A copy of the COE will be issued to the student which must be transferred along with the fee mentioned in the fee letter issued by the Japanese school, name of the school, bank account details, and the total amount to be transferred in Japanese Yen. Upon confirmation, start your documentation process, and the training session for the Visa interview process.</span></p>
